Interface Featured Timed Automata
========

This project is a small Scala implementation of the Interface Featured Timed Automata (IFTA), that will include:

 - a small scala DSL
 - composition operator of IFTAs
 - export into UPPAAL Timed Automata with features

To compile and run the tools you can use [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org), for example, by executing the command ```sbt console```.
